# Case Discussion Questions



## Technical

1. Does text data help in predicting which borrower will default?


Answer. I think the evidence points to yes.


2. Which words are most biased towards defaulting? Is this expected/intuitive?

Answer. 


3. According to the decision tree prediction models, which variables best predict a default?

Answer. 


5. What additional information might lead to a better predictive model?

Answer. 


## Managerial

Suppose that Kiva would like to operationalize the prediction model. They start by showing the predicted risk factor along side each borrower's loan request on the website.

1. What technical challenges and risks do you envision?

Answer. The model must perform the predition in a timely manner. There must be sufficient integration between the model and the webpage. The model must be constantly updated to remain current.


2. What procedural challenges and risks do you envision?

Answer. 

- Borrowers might figure out the model (i.e., which words/phrases will predict a default), and change their stories accordingly, reducing the effectivenes of the model.

- Overall lending might decrease, since anyone predicted to be risky would stop getting loans. 

- On the other hand, overall lending might increase, as lenders might be willing to lend more money to borrowers who have a positive prediction.

- Overall lending might be more concentrated than it ought to be.


3. How else might Kiva operationalize the model?

Answer. Another option is to show the risk factor to not allow the borrower to post the request if the odel predicts below a certain threshold. Another option still is to just show the predicted value to Kiva employees, who could (e.g.) use it to write a blog, report, or white paper that potential lenders could read.
