# Intro

- Who has used Kiva? 
- Why did you choose Kiva? 
- How did you choose the borrower? 
- What was your experience like? 
- Did you continue to lend to Kiva, and why or why not?


# Case Discussion Questions

Please be prepared to discuss the following questions.

1. What is Kiva's value proposition?



2. What is the primary innovation that Kiva brought to its industry?



3. How does Kiva make money?

Kiva doesn't. They're a not-for-profit. They cover their own costs by donations, grants, etc.


4. What factors might go into a lender's decision to lend money to a borrower?

- Loan amount
- Country
- Purpose
- Repayment history
- Backed by partner or not
- Feeling good about life in general


5. How does text data affect a prediction model's ability to predict a default? 

It increases the accuracy and all the other metrics.


6. Which words/phrases are most biased towards defaulting? Is this expected/intuitive?

Biased towards payment: microfinance, mifex.org, esperanza.

Biased towards non-payment: cow, dairy, cows, mary, church, maize, intends, repay


7. According to the decision tree models, which variables best predict a default?

- `nonpayment`. If "parnter", then the loan very likely to be paid.
- `Topic 8`. If present, then more likely to be paid. Topic is "children, esperanza, support, women".- 
- `Topic 12`. If present, then more likely to be paid. Topic is "rice, farmers, baba, sector."
- `country`. Kenya is most likely to default.
- `loan_amount`. Large loan are more likely to be paid.

8. What additional information might lead to a better predictive model?

Ideas from previous classes:
- Loan history
- separate models per country
- translating all to english
- extracting age from text
- extract number of children from text.


9. How would you operationalize the prediction model at Kiva? What technical challenges and risks do you envision? What procedural challenges and risks do you envision?

One way to deploy the model is to publish the prediction next to each loan request.

Some technical challenges:

- The model must perform the predition in a timely manner. 
- There must be sufficient integration between the model and the webpage. 
- The model must be constantly updated to remain current.

Some procedural challenges:

- Borrowers might figure out the model (i.e., which words/phrases will predict a default), and change their stories accordingly, reducing the effectivenes of the model.

- Overall lending might decrease, since anyone predicted to be risky would stop getting loans. 

- On the other hand, overall lending might increase, as lenders might be willing to lend more money to borrowers who have a positive prediction.

- Overall lending might be more concentrated than it ought to be.

Some other deployment ideas:

- Another option is to use the risk factor to not allow the borrower to post the request if the model predicts below a certain threshold. 

- Another option still is to just show the predicted value to Kiva employees, who could (e.g.) use it to write a blog, report, or white paper that potential lenders could read.
