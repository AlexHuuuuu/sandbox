# Introduction

[Kiva Microfunds](https://www.kiva.org/) is a non-profit that allows people to lend money to low-income entrepreneurs and students around the world. Started in 2005, Kiva has crowd-funded millions of loans with a repayment rate of 98% to 99%.


Kiva includes both traditional demographic information, such as gender and location, as well as personal stories on each borrower because Kiva wants lenders to connect with the borrowers on a human level. An example:

*Evelyn is 40 years old and married with 3 kids. She is in the Karura Hope women group and her life has been changed by the first KIVA loan she received last year which she is completing this quarter. Before she received the loan, she used to sell 9 litres of milk daily to local residents. After receiving the loan she bought iron sheets, five cement packets, one lorry of sand, some ballast and animal feed for her cows and improved her cow shed. Today she sells a daily average of 40 litres of milk to the Kiamba Dairy cooperative society, which is affiliated to the Kenya Cooperative Creameries at a cost of USD 0.28 per litre. Her daily farming has really grown. Evelyn intends to buy another dairy cow and a tank of water for home consumption and for her cows. She intends to repay in monthly installments.*

Despite her uplifting story, and her previous successful loan, Evelyn defaulted on her next loan of 900 USD.

In this case study, we will explore past Kiva loans and build a prediction model (in particular, a decision tree classifier) to predict which future borrowers will pay back loans, and which will default. A key question we will explore is: does adding text (i.e., the personal stories) to the prediction model increase or decrease the model's prediction power?

This case study will provide lots of data, tables, and graphs, but is intentionally light on commentary, analysis, and decision making. That's your job!


## Case Discussion Questions

At the end of this case study, we will have a group discussion around the following questions:

1. Does text data help in predicting which loan seeker will default?
2. Which words are most biased towards defaulting? Is this expected/intuitive?
3. According to the decision tree prediction models, what variables best predict a default?
4. As a decision maker, would you recommend the use of textual data in your prediction models?
5. As a lender, what other information would you like to have?


# Kiva Background

The key concepts in the Kiva world are:

- **Loan**. A loan is the most important concept at Kiva. Most other concepts are in some way related to a loan.

- **Borrower**. A borrower is someone who has requested a loan. Borrowers are often
referred to as *businesses* or *entrepreneurs* in order to emphasize the entrepreneurial spirit of
these individuals who work to make a difference in their lives. 

- **Lender**. A lender is a user registered on the Kiva website for the purposes of lending money and
participating in the community. Some lenders have public profiles, known as lender pages, on
the Kiva website, where they can share details about their activities and mission. Most lenders,
however, refrain from displaying their public information and are referred to as “anonymous.”

- **Partner.** A partner, or Kiva field partner, is usually a microfinance institution with which Kiva works to
find and fund loans. Every loan at Kiva is offered by a partner to a borrower, and the partner
works with Kiva to get funding for that loan from lenders.

# Data Description

The data in this case study was collected from [http://build.kiva.org](http://build.kiva.org/), Kiva's website that provides snapshots of Kiva loan data. In the full dataset, about 98% of loans are paid and 2% defaulted. In this case study, we look at only a sample of the data, where the split between paid and defaulted is closer to 50%-50%.

Let's look at our sample to understand the size, shape, values, and patterns in the variables. The sample includes `r ncol(df)` variables, named: `r colnames(df)`. Each variable is explored in turn. The `en` variable is the text variable, i.e., the personal story of the loan seeker, and will be our main source of investigation. There are `r nrow(df)` records/rows/loans in our sample.




```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Let's look at a few of the records in full.
# NEver got this to work on my machine, for some reason.
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
sample = df %>%
  slice(c(1, 5000, 6009, 444, 7322)) %>%
  select(-en, everything()) %>%
  select(-id) %>%
  mutate(en = gsub("\\\r", " ", en)) %>% 
  mutate(en = gsub("\\\n", "", en))

## Variable: status

The `status` variable indicates whether a loan was `paid` or `defaulted`. As previously described, the data has a fairly even split between these two options.

\vspace{10pt}

```{r fig.height=4}
qplot(status, data=df, geom="bar", fill=status, xlab="status") + theme(legend.position = "none")
```


\vspace{20pt}

<hr/>

Below is a table with the actual counts.

```{r}
kable(df %>%
  group_by(status) %>%
  summarize(count=n()), "latex", booktab=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width=TRUE, latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```


<P style="page-break-before: always">
\newpage


## Variable: sector

The figure below shows the number of loans in each sector, coloured by the loan's `status`. 

\vspace{10pt}

```{r fig.height=4}
qplot(sector, data=df, geom="bar", fill=status, xlab="sector")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```

Below is a tabulation of the same data.

```{r}

  group_by(sector, status) %>%
  summarize(count=n()) %>%
  spread(status, count) %>%
  mutate(total = defaulted + paid), "latex", booktab=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width=TRUE, latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```




<P style="page-break-before: always">

## Variable: country

Below is the same for the `country` variable.

\vspace{10pt}

```{r fig.height=2.5}
qplot(country, data=df, geom="bar", fill=status)
```


\vspace{20pt}
<br/>
<hr/>

```{r}
kable(df %>%

```


## Variable: gender


```{r fig.height=2.5}
qplot(gender, data=df, geom="bar", fill=status)
```


\vspace{20pt}
<br/>
<hr/>

```{r}
kable(df %>%

  kable_styling(full_width=TRUE, latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```



<P style="page-break-before: always">
\newpage
## Variable: nonpayment

The nonpayment variable captures who is liable if a loan defaults: the lender, or the partner.

\vspace{10pt}

```{r fig.height=4}
qplot(nonpayment, data=df, geom="bar", fill=status)
```

\vspace{20pt}
<br/>
<hr/>

```{r}
kable(df %>%
  group_by(nonpayment, status) %>%
  summarize(count=n()) %>%
  spread(status, count) %>%
  mutate(total = defaulted + paid), "latex", booktab=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width=TRUE, latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```





<P style="page-break-before: always">

## Variable: loan_amount

Unlike the other variables thus far, the `loan_amount` variable is numeric. Below is a density plot, which shows the most popular loan amounts.


```{r fig.height=2.5}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(loan_amount)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha=0.6) 
```

Below are separate density curves for `status=defaulted` and `status=paid`.

```{r fig.height=2.5}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(loan_amount, colour=status, fill=status)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.1)
```

Below is a filled density plot:

```{r fig.height=2.5}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(loan_amount, colour=status, fill=status)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.1, position="fill") 
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
df$loan_amount.cut = cut(df$loan_amount, breaks=c(0, 300, 600, 900, 1500))
addmargins(table(df$loan_amount.cut, df$status, dnn=c("loan_amount.cut", "status")))
```





<P style="page-break-before: always">
\newpage
## Variable: en

The `en` variable is raw English text, and there's lots of ways to look at it.

### Length

The figure below is a density plot of the length (number of characters/letters).

```{r fig.height=2.5}
df %>%
  mutate(en_length = nchar(en)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(en_length, colour=status, fill=status)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.1) +
  labs(x = "Number of characters in `en`")
```

### Top Words

The table below shows the top (i.e, most frequently occuring) words.

```{r rows.print=20}
kable(text_df %>% group_by(word) %>%
  summarize(count=n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = count / sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  top_n(20), "latex", booktab=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width=TRUE, latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```


<P style="page-break-before: always">
\newpage

### Most Biased Words

The plots below show which words are most biased towards being `paid` or `defaulted`, using the log odds ratio metric.

```{r}
status_words_count = text_df %>% group_by(status, word) %>%
  summarize(count=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

log_ratios = status_words_count %>% 
  spread (status, count) %>%
  select(-`<NA>`) %>%
  mutate(defaulted = ifelse(is.na(defaulted), 0, defaulted)) %>%
  mutate(paid = ifelse(is.na(paid), 0, paid)) %>%
  mutate(total=defaulted+paid) %>%
  mutate(log_ratio = log2(paid/defaulted)) 
```

```{r, fig.height=4}
log_ratios %>%
  filter(total > 500) %>%
  group_by(log_ratio < 0) %>%
  top_n(15, abs(log_ratio)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, log_ratio)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, log_ratio, fill = log_ratio < 0)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  ylab("log odds ratio") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "", labels = c("paid", "default"))
```


Below are tabular versions of the same data above, starting with the words that are biased towards `paid`:

```{r}
kable(log_ratios %>%
  filter(total > 500) %>%
  arrange(desc(log_ratio)) %>%
  top_n(17), "latex", booktab=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width=TRUE, latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```


<P style="page-break-before: always">
\newpage


And those that are biased towards `default`:

```{r rows.print=20}
kable(log_ratios %>%
  filter(total > 500) %>%
  arrange((log_ratio)) %>%
  top_n(-20), "latex", booktab=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width=TRUE, latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```

<!--
Let's use the TF-IDF metric to see which words are the most "important":
-->

```{r, eval=FALSE}
book_words <- text_df %>%
  select(-status) %>%
  count(id, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()

book_words %>% arrange(desc(n))

total_words <- book_words %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(n))
total_words %>% arrange(desc(total))

book_words <- left_join(book_words, total_words)

freq_by_rank <- book_words %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  mutate(rank = row_number(), 
         `term frequency` = n/total)
book_words_tfidf <- book_words %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, id, n)

book_words_tfidf %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))
```







<P style="page-break-before: always">
\newpage


## LDA Topics

Next, we used a techinque called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to automatically extract high-level topics from the documents. We told LDA to extract the `12` most important topics; LDA will also tell us which topics are in which documents. For example, a document might have 50% of its words come from topic 1, 25% of its words come from topic 5, and the remaining 25% of its words come from topic 12.

### LDA Top Terms Per Topic

This figure shows the top terms (words) in each of the 12 discovered topic.

```{r,fig.width=10,fig.height=8}
ap_top_terms <- lda_beta %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  top_n(10, beta) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta)

ap_top_terms %>%
  mutate(term = reorder(term, beta)) %>%
  left_join(tn, by=c("topic" = "id")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(term, beta, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic_name, scales = "free", ncol=3) +
  coord_flip()
```


<P style="page-break-before: always">
\newpage

### Documents per LDA Topic

The figure below shows the number of documents that contain each topic (i.e., more than 5%), coloured by `status`.

```{r}
topic_totals = lda_gamma %>%
  left_join(df, by=c("document" = "id")) %>%
  select(c(-en)) %>% 
  filter(gamma >= 0.05) %>%
  group_by(topic, status) %>% 
  summarize(count=n()) %>%
  spread(status, count) %>%
  mutate(total = defaulted + paid) %>% 
  left_join(tn, by=c("topic" = "id")) %>%
  select(topic, topic_name, everything())
```

```{r fig.height=5}
tmp_gathered = topic_totals %>% 
  select(topic, topic_name, defaulted, paid) %>% 
  gather(Status, Value, defaulted, paid)

ggplot(tmp_gathered, aes(x=topic_name, y=Value, fill=Status)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, hjust = 1)) 
```

```{r}
kable(topic_totals, "latex", booktab=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width=TRUE, latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```

### LDA Examples

Below is an example of an application whose `en` variable contained LDA topic 8 at 99%. 

*Senaida Agueda has a business in which she buys and resells clothing that she has been operating for about 2 years now with the help of loans from Esperanza. She has two children, 41 and 38, whom do not live with Mrs. Agueda. When not working with her clothing shop, she enjoys going to the beach and cooking, arroz con carne (rice with meat) being one of her favorite dishes. As Mrs. Agueda is in her elder years and has fully grown children, she simply wishes to sustain her business to support her and her husband. Mrs. Senaida Agueda is a member of an eight person group, Group 4, that is part of a larger micro-bank called Mujeres de Fe, "Women of Faith" in English. In the picture, Mrs. Agueda is third from the right along with members of her group and some others of Mujeres de Fe. Her story is just one of a list of men and women who are improving their quality of life through the help of micro-credit loans of Esperanza. Together, this group has united with a common vision of a better life with faith and hope in their hearts and an unbreakable spirit. The concept of group lending is to have loans paid in a group to reduce the risk of a person defaulting, as others pick up where a person may lag to receive the next loan. Each of the associates in this bank has a similar business whether it is a motor taxi service or selling cosmetics. Thank you for your support and awareness of this issue, and it is your concern and efforts that is able to bring a difference to the lives of people such as Mrs. Agueda.*

Below is an example for LDA topic 4: 

 *Descripcin del Negocio. La Sra Angela se dedica a la venta de articulos para el hogar a credito y de forma anbulante ademas vende golosinas a llos nios de una escuela. En la actualidad vende a personas de otros sectores que han sido recomendados por buenos clientes que le refieren esos sitios. Uso del Prstamo. Ella necesita el credito para comprar mas mercaderia pues en estas epocas de fin de aos le son muy solicitadas. Informacin Personal. Ella tiene 29 aos y tiene dos hijos que estudian su casa es de caa y tiene estabilidad familiar. Translated from Spanish by Kiva Volunteer Wendy Wise*


And finally, below is an example for LDA topic 1:

*Mary is 65 years of age, married with six children. All her children are married and self-reliant. She is a member of St Jude group at Githunguri in Thika district. Mary is earns her income as a dairy farmer. She needs a USD 150 loan to help her buy another small high breed dairy calf, which she will raise to maturity. She plans to meet her repayments on monthly basis.*


```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ids = lda_gamma %>%
  filter(topic==1) %>%
  arrange(desc(gamma)) %>%
  top_n(1000) %>%
  left_join(df_new, by=c("document" = "id")) %>%
  mutate(len = nchar(en)) %>%
  arrange(len)
ids
ids = c(7830, 7306, 7258, 7105)

df[7306,3]

# Building a Classifier Model

Now that we have explored the data, it’s time to dive deeper. Which variable(s) are the biggest predictors of `status`? This is where classifier models shine. They can tell us exactly how all the variables relate to each other, and which are most important.
 
A decision tree is a popular classifier model in analytics. Here, the decision tree is automatically created by a machine learning algorithm as it learns simple decision rules from the data. These automatically-learned rules can then be used to both understand the variables and to predict future data. A big advantage of decision trees over other classifier models is that they are relatively simple for humans to understand and interpret.
 
A decision tree consists of nodes. Each node splits the data according to a rule. A rule is based on a variable in the data. For example, a rule might be “Age greater than 30.” In this case, the node splits the data by the age variable; those passengers that satisfy the rule (i.e., are greater than 30) follow the left path out of the node; the rest follow the right path out of the node. In this way, paths from the root node down to leaf nodes are created, describing the fate of certain types of passengers.
 
A decision tree path always starts with a root node (node number 1), which contains the most important splitting rule. Each subsequent node contains the next most important rule. After the decision tree is automatically created by the machine learning algorithm, one can use the decision tree to classify an individual by simply following a path: start at the root node and apply each rule to follow the appropriate path until you hit an end.
 
When creating a decision tree from data, the analyst can specify the number of nodes for the machine learning algorithm to create. More nodes leads to a more accurate model, at the cost of a more complicated and harder-to-interpret model. Likewise, fewer nodes usually leads to a less accurate model, but the model is easier to understand and interpret. 
 
 
 
 
<P style="page-break-before: always">

## A Prediction Model without the Text

First, as a baseline, we trained a decision tree classifier model without using any of the text or topics. Below is a graphical depiction of the model after it has been trained:

```{r fig.height=3}
set.seed(123)
# Don't want to use either of these for prediction, and the - sign doesn't work
# with rpart forumulas.
df_notext = subset(df_new, select=c(status, sector, country, gender, loan_amount, nonpayment))

# Split the data into training and testing.
train_notext <- sample_frac(df_notext, 0.8)
test_notext <- setdiff(df_notext, train_notext)


# Let's train the model.
form = as.formula(status ~ .)
tree <- rpart(form, train_notext, method="class")
rpart.plot(tree, extra=2)
```

\vspace{20pt}

To measure the prediction performance, we used some never-before-seen data (called _testing data_). We gave the testing data to the classifier, asked it to make a prediction (i.e., whether the borrower will pay or not), and then compared it to the true answer. 

The following table summarizes the predictions of the classifier.

```{r}
predicted = predict(tree, test_notext, type="class")
actual = test_notext$status
preds = data.frame((table(predicted, actual))) %>%
  spread(actual, Freq) %>%
  mutate(total = defaulted + paid) %>%
  select(predicted, total, everything())

kable(preds, "latex", booktab=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width=TRUE, latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down")) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 2, "actual" = 2))
```

That is, the model predicted `defaulted` 74 times: 50 times correctly, and 24 times incorrectly. It predicted `paid` 159 times: 120 times correctly, and 39 times incorrectly.

Below is the accuracy and other metrics of the classifier on the testing data.

```{r}
print(sprintf("Accuracy:    %.3f", Accuracy(y_true=actual, y_pred=predicted)))
print(sprintf("Precision:   %.3f", Precision(y_true=actual, y_pred=predicted)))
print(sprintf("Recall:      %.3f", Recall(y_true=actual, y_pred=predicted)))
print(sprintf("F1 Score:    %.3f", F1_Score(predicted, actual)))
print(sprintf("Sensitivity: %.3f", Sensitivity(y_true=actual, y_pred=predicted)))
print(sprintf("Specificity: %.3f", Specificity(y_true=predicted, y_pred=actual)))
```

We then built the same kind of decision tree classifier model as before, except now, we included the LDA topics, which were built from the text. (Note: there are many _other_ textual features we could include in this model: individual words, clusters, etc. However, we  kept it simple for now.) Below is the result.

```{r fig.height=3}
set.seed(123)
# Don't want to use either of these for prediction, and the - sign doesn't work
# with rpart forumulas.
df_text = subset(df_new, select=c(-id, -en))

# Split the data into training and testing.
train_text <- sample_frac(df_text, 0.8)
test_text <- setdiff(df_text, train_text)


# Let's create the model.
form = as.formula(status ~ .)
tree <- rpart(form, train_text, method="class")
rpart.plot(tree, extra=2)
```

Below is a summary of its predictions:

```{r}
predicted = predict(tree, test_text, type="class")
actual = test_text$status
preds.text = data.frame((table(predicted, actual))) %>%
  spread(actual, Freq) %>%
  mutate(total = defaulted + paid) %>%
  select(predicted, total, everything())


kable(preds.text, "latex", booktab=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width=TRUE, latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down")) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 2, "actual" = 2))
```

Metrics:

```{r}
print(sprintf("Accuracy:    %.3f", Accuracy(y_true=actual, y_pred=predicted)))
print(sprintf("Precision:   %.3f", Precision(y_true=actual, y_pred=predicted)))
print(sprintf("Recall:      %.3f", Recall(y_true=actual, y_pred=predicted)))
print(sprintf("F1 Score:    %.3f", F1_Score(predicted, actual)))
print(sprintf("Sensitivity: %.3f", Sensitivity(y_true=actual, y_pred=predicted)))
print(sprintf("Specificity: %.3f", Specificity(y_true=predicted, y_pred=actual)))
```
